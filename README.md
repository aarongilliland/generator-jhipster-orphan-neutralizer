## Sub Generator for Killing Orphans (Affectionately named Orphan Killer)

##### This is a project for the cleanup of orphaned content from previous runs of the jhipster jdl-import capability. This will not use version control but attempts to match the JDL against the content in the directory trees.

##### This is fun to be programming again.
